### Variable Exploration

#### Convert categorical columns to appropriate data types

The code identifies categorical columns in a pandas DataFrame, converts them to the category data type for efficiency and memory optimization
categorical_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
for col in categorical_columns:
    df[col] = df[col].astype('category')

## Violin Plot Analysis (Symptom frequency with respect to usage)

### Interpretations:
* Individuals who experience symptoms "frequently" tend to report a wider range of symptoms compared to those who experience symptoms "rarely" or "never."
* The symptom "All of these" is more prevalent among those who experience symptoms "frequently."
* There's an overlap in symptoms across different frequency categories, indicating some commonalities in reported symptoms.   
### 4.Contingency table and Chi-square test

## Chi-Square Test Results
### Purpose: To determine if there's a relationship between "Mobile phone activities" and "Performance impact".

### Findings:
* Chi-square statistic: 26.79
* P-value: 0.3141
* Degrees of freedom: 24
  
### Interpretation:
* The p-value is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05.
* This indicates that there is no significant association between "Mobile phone activities" and "Performance impact".
* The observed frequencies in the contingency table are not significantly different from the expected frequencies under the assumption of independence.
* 
### Conclusion:
Based on the Chi-square test, there is no evidence to suggest a relationship between mobile phone activities and performance impact in the dataset.

 ### Contingency Table Analysis
* The heatmap presents a contingency table showing the relationship between mobile phone activities and their perceived impact on performance.

### Key Observations:
* Most respondents who engage in "All of these" activities agree that it impacts their performance.
* Messaging seems to have the least impact on performance.
* Social Media activities show a mixed impact, with a higher number of respondents agreeing on a negative impact.
* There are relatively few responses for the combined activities and their impact.

### Overall:
*The table suggests a potential correlation between certain mobile phone activities and their perceived impact on performance, with "All of these" activities showing the strongest association with a negative impact.

## 5.Health precautions vs. usage symptoms
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0328fde6-f001-49bd-9f3f-742524671c7d)
## Image Analysis: Health Precautions vs. Daily Usages.

### General Trends:
* Regardless of the health precaution, "All of these" symptoms tend to be more prevalent.
* Symptoms like headache, sleep disturbance, and anxiety appear to be common across different health precaution groups.
* There seems to be a variation in symptom frequency among different health precautions.
  
### Specific Observations:
* The "Using Blue light filter" group shows a relatively higher frequency of "Headache" and "Sleep disturbance" compared to other groups.
*The "None of Above" group exhibits a higher frequency of "All of these" symptoms.

#### Overall, the charts suggest a correlation between certain health precautions and specific usage symptoms, indicating potential areas for further analysis and intervention.


## 6. Data Encoding and Splitting
### Encoding Categorical Variables
To prepare the data for modeling, we need to convert categorical variables into a numerical format. We use Label Encoding to achieve this
### Feature Selection and Train/Test Split
We separate the features and the target variable, then split the data into training and testing sets to avoid data leakage and ensure proper model evaluation



## 7.Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
We performed hyperparameter tuning on a Random Forest Classifier using GridSearchCV to identify the best combination of parameters for our model.

### Hyperparameter Grid:

* n_estimators: [50, 100, 200]
* max_depth: [None, 10, 20, 30]
* min_samples_split: [2, 5, 10]
* min_samples_leaf: [1, 2, 4]


### Best Parameters:
After evaluating 540 different combinations, the best parameters found were:

* max_depth: None
* min_samples_leaf: 4
* min_samples_split: 2
* n_estimators: 100
These parameters provided the most optimal performance for our dataset.

## 8.Feature Importance
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f59966d-bea9-4ab2-bebf-4a0244e57bd9)
The plot above shows the relative importance of each feature in the model. Features such as 'Symptom frequency', 'Health precautions', and 'Useful features' have the highest importance, indicating their significant impact on the model's performance. Other features like 'Mobile Phone' and 'Helpful for studying' have the least importance.

# Conclusion
* The analysis aimed to understand the impact of various factors on performance. Factors such as age, gender, mobile phone usage patterns, health conditions, and study habits were considered.

* Preliminary findings suggest that several factors contribute to performance impact. These include mobile phone activities, daily usage, health conditions, and symptoms.
