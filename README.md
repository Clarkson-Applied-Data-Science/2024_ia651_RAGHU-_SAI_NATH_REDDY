## Violin Plot Analysis (Symptom frequency with respect to usage)

### Interpretations:
* Individuals who experience symptoms "frequently" tend to report a wider range of symptoms compared to those who experience symptoms "rarely" or "never."
* The symptom "All of these" is more prevalent among those who experience symptoms "frequently."
* There's an overlap in symptoms across different frequency categories, indicating some commonalities in reported symptoms.

## Image Analysis: Health Precautions vs. Daily Usages.

### General Trends:
* Regardless of the health precaution, "All of these" symptoms tend to be more prevalent.
* Symptoms like headache, sleep disturbance, and anxiety appear to be common across different health precaution groups.
* There seems to be a variation in symptom frequency among different health precautions.
  
### Specific Observations:
* The "Using Blue light filter" group shows a relatively higher frequency of "Headache" and "Sleep disturbance" compared to other groups.
*The "None of Above" group exhibits a higher frequency of "All of these" symptoms.

#### Overall, the charts suggest a correlation between certain health precautions and specific usage symptoms, indicating potential areas for further analysis and intervention.

## Chi-Square Test Results
### Purpose: To determine if there's a relationship between "Mobile phone activities" and "Performance impact".

### Findings:
* Chi-square statistic: 26.79
* P-value: 0.3141
* Degrees of freedom: 24
  
### Interpretation:
* The p-value is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05.
* This indicates that there is no significant association between "Mobile phone activities" and "Performance impact".
* The observed frequencies in the contingency table are not significantly different from the expected frequencies under the assumption of independence.
* 
### Conclusion:
Based on the Chi-square test, there is no evidence to suggest a relationship between mobile phone activities and performance impact in the dataset.

## Contingency Table Analysis
* The heatmap presents a contingency table showing the relationship between mobile phone activities and their perceived impact on performance.

### Key Observations:
* Most respondents who engage in "All of these" activities agree that it impacts their performance.
* Messaging seems to have the least impact on performance.
* Social Media activities show a mixed impact, with a higher number of respondents agreeing on a negative impact.
* There are relatively few responses for the combined activities and their impact.

### Overall:
*The table suggests a potential correlation between certain mobile phone activities and their perceived impact on performance, with "All of these" activities showing the strongest association with a negative impact.

.

## Overfitting Detected
* Training Accuracy of 1.0 indicates the model perfectly predicts all instances in the training data.
* Test Accuracy significantly lower suggests the model is not generalizing well to unseen data.

## Potential Solutions:
* Cross-validation: Evaluate model performance on different subsets of the data to get a more reliable estimate.
* Pruning: Simplify the model by removing unnecessary components.
* Regularization: Introduce penalties to the model to prevent overfitting.

## Model Predictions vs. Actual Values
* Model Predictions: [3, 0, 0, 0, 1] are the values predicted by the model for the corresponding instances.
*Actual Values: [41, 2, 23, 2, 57, 0, 97, 0, 0, 0] are the true or correct values for the same instances.

# Conclusion
* The analysis aimed to understand the impact of various factors on performance. Factors such as age, gender, mobile phone usage patterns, health conditions, and study habits were considered.

* Preliminary findings suggest that several factors contribute to performance impact. These include mobile phone activities, daily usage, health conditions, and symptoms.
